I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Accounting & Information Systems at Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University--New Brunswick. My academic journey includes earning a Ph.D. in Management Science with a focus on Accounting from the University of Texas at Dallas, as well as Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Finance from Peking University, China. Prior to my current position at Rutgers, I served as a faculty member at both McGill University and the National University of Singapore. Additionally, I obtained valuable insights from my experience in the banking industry.
