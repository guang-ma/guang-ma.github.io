I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Accounting & Information Systems at Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University--New Brunswick. My academic journey includes earning a Ph.D. in Management Science with a focus on Accounting from the University of Texas at Dallas, as well as Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Finance from Peking University, China. Prior to my current position at Rutgers, I served as a faculty member at both McGill University and the National University of Singapore. Additionally, I obtained valuable insights from my experience in the banking industry.

My research interests encompass corporate financial reporting and voluntary disclosure, information gathering and processing of investors and financial analysts, financial regulations, alongside applications of machine learning and data analytics in capital markets and corporate decision-making. Methodologically, I rely primarily on archival empirical methods supplemented by analytical modeling to explore these areas comprehensively.

My teaching interests include: Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI in Accounting and Auditing, Financial Accounting (at all levels, including introductory, intermediate, and advanced), Accounting Theory, Accounting Information System, and Ph.D. Research Seminars.
